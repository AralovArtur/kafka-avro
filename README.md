# kafka-avro
This project demonstrates how to use Apache Kafka with Avro for message serialization and deserialization. It includes examples for setting up Kafka producers and consumers that interact with Avro schemas for efficient data transfer and validation.

- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed event streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
- **Avro**: A framework for data serialization, used to define schemas and ensure compatibility between producer and consumer.
- **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Confluent Schema Registry**: Centralized service for managing Avro schemas and ensuring schema compatibility in Kafka.
